README for Phylogenomics repo
Karolina Heyduk 2014

This repository is a place I'll store somewhat random scripts I've created for various phylogenomic uses, including:

-file conversion/formatting
-alignment manipulation
-tree manipulations

Please be aware that none of this is guaranteed to work on your data, as it was written largely for mine. I've tried to make most of these as user friendly as possible, some modifications might be necessary for them to work for you. All scripts are in Perl, using BioPerl heavily.
